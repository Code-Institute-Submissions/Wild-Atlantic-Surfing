<section class="1st-paragraph">

        <p>With the right weather, the north, south, and west coasts of Ireland can be home to some of the best surfing waves
         in the world. Gulf Stream storm activity generates large swells all year round, but the best times for surfing are in 
         early summer or throughout the autumn months when the water temperature reaches its peak at about 17 degrees Celsius. 
         In winter, wind from close-range North Atlantic storms, water temperature below 8 degrees and inclement weather make 
         winter surfing a much tougher proposition and only for the truly dedicated.</p>

    <h3>Surfing West of along the Atlantic Way</h3>

 <!-- Bootstrap Columns start at 50% wide on mobile and bump up to 33.3% wide on desktop ---------------------------------->

  <div class="row">

    <div class="col">
    <h3>Bundoran, Co. Donegal</h3>

    <p>Surfing has become synonymous with Bundoran in the past number of years. 
    Its growing popularity has helped to extend the normal Easter to September holiday
     season to all year round as surfers travel from all over the country and all over the world
      to experience the diverse natural amenities that Ireland’s Premier Seaside Resort has to offer. 
      Any weekend in any month, be it the middle of summer or the dead of winter, you’ll generally find
       somewhere to go surfing in Bundoran or its surrounds with countless beach and reef breaks to be 
       found in close proximity.</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="col">
    <h3>Mullaghmore, Co. Sligo</h3>

    <p>Mullaghmore in Sligo, Ireland has become known as one of the world’s prime big–wave surf destinations.
     Capable of holding the biggest swells the Atlantic has to offer, this wave attracts some of the worlds most
      experienced surfers. It is located a few kilometers from one of Ireland’s most popular surf towns Bundoran in Donegal.
     The surf spot has grown in fame ever since Billabong hosted Ireland’s first ever big-wave surf contest back in 2011,
      which saw surfers from around the world surf Mullaghmore, getting towed into 25ft barrels much to the amazement
       of the hundreds of spectators watching from the headland. There have also been several Billabong XXL Wave of
        The Year nominations from Mullaghmore and the big wave spot features heavily on entries at the prestigious
         Doolin’s Surf Festival held in County Clare each March.

    <div class="col">
    <h3>Doolin Point, Co. Clare</h3>

    <p>In the heart of the Burren at Fanore Beach, Co. Clare, Ireland. Situated in one of
     the most scenic areas of the Wild Atlantic Way. Because of its relative remoteness
      from heavily populated centres, it does not enjoy the fame attached to less attractive
       but better known surf destinations in Ireland. All the better for those who come here!
    
    County Clare is renowned for its surfing and Doolin Point is a great example of that.
     It’s just down the road from the much busier Lahinch and offers up some killer waves.
      The Cliffs of Moher provide a breath taking and intimidating backdrop to Doolin Point.
        With the biggest breaks running along the cliffs this is one for experienced surfers,
         as it has the potential to get pretty huge.
    </p>

</div>


    <div class="col">
    <h3>Ballybunion, Co. Kerry</h3>

    <p>BALLYBUNION has been named amongst the best of the best in terms of summer getaway destinations
     for surfing. The area has been ranked fifth best in the country as a surfing spot by leading surf
      travel provider ‘surfholidays.com’ who ranked what they considered to be the best places to surf along our coasts.
    In what will surely be another big boost for tourism in the area, the list was compiled over a fortnight and took into 
    account factors such as surf breaks, cafés and amenities, nightlife, family friendly options, surf schools in the area 
    and the general ‘vibe’ of the surf community. The report on the website states that “when travelling the Wild Atlantic Way,
    Ballybunion in Co.Kerry is simply not to be missed.”
