# Wild Atlantic Surfing

This is a static front-end website and it is designed to convey specific and helpful information in regards to surfing
in Ireland. In particular, this website is to promote surfing in Ireland as an international tourist destination as well
raise awareness to people in Ireland who maybe considering trying surfing. The website will provide information for the
top 4 surfing locations along the atlantic coast of the West of Ireland. This will include locations of beaches, a frequently
asked questions section, a gallery below the individual webpage.

 
## UX
 
 This website is to promote and provide useful infomration for the surfing community based in Ireland. The website was 
 designed with the user experience in mind. Breathtaking pictures were chosen to show the raw unfilterd beauty of the some
 of the best surfing beaches along the Atlantic way. More specifically, the website was targeted on millenials age group and lower.
In this covid-19 era and current travel restrictions, people are waking up the great outdoors which has been on their doorstep.
A wire frame mockup using **Balsamiq** was used to develope the intial site layout. If a person living in the Ireland was so inclined
go for a drive and emerse themselves in nature through surfing. Based on their location, they have the locatiions and background information
on 4 potential surfing locations. The color green was chosen to simulate seaweed.

Please see attached the mock for the MS1 wild atlantic surfing.
Atmittedly, the project did change from the initial web design.
